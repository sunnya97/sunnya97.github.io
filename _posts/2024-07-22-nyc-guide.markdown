## Theater & Shows

- **[Life and Trust Show](https://lifeandtrustnyc.com/)** – A really cool choose-your-own-adventure show (different actors are acting in different parts of the building, and you can choose which one to follow).
- **[Drunk Shakespeare](https://a.drunkshakespeare.com/)** – A rendition of *Macbeth* but where the actors are all drunk.

### Broadway Recommendations

- **[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child](https://broadway.harrypottertheplay.com/)** – Is cool because they worked with professional magicians to incorporate “magic tricks” into the show.
- **[Hamilton](https://hamiltonmusical.com/new-york/)** – I’ve listened to *Hamilton* so many times (literally probably over 40 times). I thought seeing it live wouldn’t be that worth it, but it was actually pretty awesome.
- **[Wicked](https://wickedthemusical.com/tickets/#broadway?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search)** – I haven’t been, but Coco (who’s been to 15+ Broadway shows!) recommends it.

## Museums & Culture

- **[The Met (Metropolitan Museum of Art)](https://www.metmuseum.org/)** – I’m not much of an art museum person, but this is an Art History museum, so it’s really nice for the history aspect.
- **[Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum](https://intrepidmuseum.org/)** – A retired aircraft carrier turned museum. Has fighter jets, a submarine, and even a space shuttle.
- **9/11 Museum** – A deeply moving museum documenting the events and impact of September 11, 2001.  
  - While you’re there, also check out **The Oculus** nearby—it’s a mall that looks cool from the inside.
- **American Museum of Natural History** – It’s where *Night at the Museum* took place!
- **United Nations** – If you’re into global politics, you can take a tour of the UN Headquarters.

## Food & Drinks

- **Xian Famous Foods** – Spicy hand-pulled noodles.
- **Liberty Bagels** – Solid bagel spot with good variety.
- **Toribro Ramen** – My favorite ramen spot.
- **Prince Pizza** – Get the square-style pepperoni one.
- **Joe’s Pizza** – A classic NYC slice.
- **Halal Guys** – Have to get the one from the street cart on 53rd and 6th. The other locations are meh.
- **Los Tacos No. 1** – One of the best taco spots in the city. Recommend the pork one.
- **Katz’s Delicatessen** – Legendary pastrami sandwiches.
- **Max Brenner** – Get the *Italian Thick Hot Chocolate*—it’s basically melted chocolate in a cup.

## Parks & Outdoor Spots

- **The High Line** – An old elevated rail line turned into a walking path. Nice to walk down the west side.
- **Central Park** – I mean, kind of obvious. But nice to bike around or picnic in the summer. In winter, they have the biggest outdoor skating rink in the city.
- **Times Square** – I guess, it’s a classic. You kind of have to.
- **The Edge** – One of the “high spots to see the city” like the Empire State and Top of the Rock.  
  - *Life hack:* There’s a restaurant up there—make a reservation and you can go up for free!

## Drinks & Nightlife

- **Pocha 32** – Get the pineapple soju (*it’s soju in a pineapple!*).
- **McSorley’s Old Ale House** – One of the oldest bars in NYC. No frills, just old-school vibes and house-made ale.
- **East Village and West Village** – My favorites for bar hopping.  
  - *East Village* is more dive-y and casual, while  
  - *West Village* is a bit more upscale.

## Miscellaneous

- **Caveat NYC** – These guys have a bunch of “nerdy” comedy shows and trivia tournaments. [Check out their events here.](https://www.caveat.nyc/)
- **Nonsense NYC** – A weekly newsletter that has a bunch of events.  
  - It might be hard to access the current week’s issue if you haven’t already subscribed. Just ask me to forward it to your email if needed. [Check it out here.](http://www.nonsensenyc.com/)
- **Escape Rooms** – There’s a bunch of fun escape rooms in the city. My favorite is probably *Escape the Room NYC.* [Check them out here.](https://escapetheroomnyc.com/)
- **Comedy Shows** – Lots of comedy shows in West Village.  
  - Check out *The Cellar, The Village Underground,* or *Fat Black Pussycat*.

Enjoy NYC!
